<h1>
    Hints for using this application</h1>

<div class="margeur-20"></div>

<div class="fckeditor">
    <p>
        This application enables you to create and print the financial tables required for your business plan.
    </p>

    <p>
        By default, the forecast is planned for 3 years, but you have the option to add as many years as you wish beyond that.
    </p>

    <p class="italic">
        BIC advice: choose the duration that most clearly illustrates the date at which your company will become structurally profitable and generate return on investment. Except in a few specific and generally rare cases, there is no need to elaborate a business
        plan exceeding 5 years.
    </p>

    <p>
        Other than the first year, which is detailed on a monthly basis by default, the application takes an annual approach for the following years. At any time, you may switch to a detailed month-by-month approach (by default, your annual figures are smoothed
        out over 12 months).
    </p>

    <p>
        Your financial file is comprised of 3 series of tables.
    </p>

    <p>
        - Forecast budgets for receipts and expenses by type: sales, purchases, general expenses, fixed assets, etc. <br /> - Summary tables based on a classic French type presentation &nbsp;<i class="fs-18 fa fa-question-circle tool-tip cpointer" title="A traditional French-style presentation shows company expenses by type: it therefore contains the purchases, 'other purchases and external expenses' that correspond to the company's general expenses, as well as human resource expenses (salaries and charges).
"></i>, <br /> - Summary tables based on an Anglo-Saxon type presentation &nbsp;<i class="fs-18 fa fa-question-circle tool-tip cpointer" title="An 'Anglo-Saxon' type presentation is increasingly required by French investors and financiers, as it provides a different way to interpret your financial results. It groups expenses analytically, based on the function to which they correspond. Your 'P&L' (Profit & Loss, equivalent to the French income statement) includes production costs, or 'Cost of Sales,' as well as all horizontal expenses referred to as 'operating expenses,' grouped into 3 families: 'Sales & Marketing,' 'Research & Development,' and 'General & Administrative.'

    <p>
        Fill in the tables following the order indicated by the application flow, starting with budgets. You may go back and modify your data entry at any time. Data is entered only into "French style" budgets and summary tables, whereas the Anglo-Saxon style
        tables are read-only.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="underline">How to fill in the tables?</span><br /> Read the instructions provided for each page before entering data.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="underline">How to add comments?</span><br /> You may add comments to each table by editing a note in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. You may choose whether or not to print your notes when you print your Business Plan. These
        notes may be useful for storing different hypothetical options.
    </p>

    <p>
        <span class="underline">How to share data and make comments on it?</span><br /> By default, you are the only one with access rights, but you can give read-only access rights to as many people as you want. Authorized people can see your tables
        and notes, but they can only interact for the specific purpose of "discussion," which may also be edited in the lower right-hand side of your screen in order to exchange ideas. This field is not printed.
